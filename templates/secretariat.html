            <p>Introducing Arjun Patel, the multi-talented and intelligent, Secretary General of Statecraft as well as Chairperson of the United Nations Security Council. With a long history in the MUN circuit, he has an intense love for debating, which is complimented by his innate sense of right and wrong. As Director General of Statecraft 2024, Arjun has had an extensive experience organising conferences for LPHS. When it comes to things he's passionate about, there's no compromise when it comes to the amount of work and dedication he puts in. <br><br>He balances out this work ethic with a quick and witty sense of humour that's always sure to bring a smile to your face when you need it the most. Despite being a economics student, he's a geek at heart, quoting characters like Yoda from Star Wars or even talking about his favorite demigod from the Percy Jackson series. Being the perfect middle ground between a geek and a businessman, Arjun is the perfect chairperson and Secretary General.</p>

            <p>Meet Para Thanavala, the official Deputy Secretary General and the unofficial mom of the OC. 
                <br><br>Respected and loved immensely by anyone to has the privilege to call her a friend, with sarcastic quips at the tip of her tongue and a heart of gold - she can only be described as Gina Linetti. 
                <br><br>Para is the kind of person everyone dreams of having by their side. She brings a sense of warmth and comfort to her friends and acts like an unwavering pillar of support, especially when things get chaotic — and they always do. Her work ethic can only be described as admirable, balancing study guides and sanity with equal grace. Whether it's meeting deadlines or reading her never-ending TBR, Para does it all — and makes it look effortless.
               <br><br> Sharp, steady, and always one step ahead, she’s the force that keeps the Secretariat grounded. She's the one with the best advice, the razor sharp comebacks and carries herself with an air of confidence and unmatched aura. A mentor, a motivator, and the calm in every storm — Para Thanavala is more than just the Deputy Secretary General, she’s the heartbeat of Statecraft. </p>
